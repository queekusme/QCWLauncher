Updates#06/05/2013##A new launcher release has been pushed, please go to https://github.com/queekusme/QCWLauncher/raw/master/QCWLauncher.jar to download it. Also a new version of The Potion Game has been released, it can be accessed with both launchers however it is best to update. To see if you;re upto date, here's the latest info:##Latest Launcher Version: Pre-Alpha[0.0.0.6]#Latest Game Version: Pre-Alpha[0.0.0.13]##Launcher Info#05/05/2013##This Launcher should download the news section every time you load the launcher, if it's blank then it's either crashed or you have no internet connection. If this happens, reload it and if it constantly is blank then contact me, queekusme@gmail.com.##Also when you hit log in, although there is no log in functionality, the launcher will download and start the latest release for my game so you do not need to download any other files yourself. If it fails to launch the game then the .jar file should be in the same directory as the launcher jar so double click that and if that fails to load then update to java 1.7 as it's still a bit buggy on java 1.6. if that still fails then contact me and I'll see what I can do :)##--------------------##New Launcher being developed#05/05/2013##A new game launcher is being developed to house all of Queekus Code-Work's games, the only game currently compatible is "ThePotionGame", which in itself is still in development.
