<table border = 1><tr><td><font size = 6><u>Reformatted News</u></font><br><i>13/05/2013</i><br>I've reformatted the news into this table format so that it's easier to distinguish between articles.<br><br> There is a new launcher release along side this that contains some styling options. Although they are not strictly required to display the news it's reccomended that you update:<br>a) because it's a newer release and <br>b) I'd like your feedback on the colour schemes.<br><br>Download:<br><a href="https://github.com/queekusme/QCWLauncher/raw/master/QCWLauncher.jar">Alpha[0.0.2.6]</a><br><a href="https://raw.github.com/queekusme/QCWLauncher/master/Changelog.txt">Changelog</a></td></tr></table><P><table border = 1><tr><td><font size = 6><u>New News</u></font><br><i>10/05/2013</i><br>The news system has changed!
